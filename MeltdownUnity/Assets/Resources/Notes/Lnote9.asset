  Title: 'To: Dima'
  Content: Who would've thought that this dumbass actually found something worth
    the journey - last time we shovelled the whole garbage yard because this idiot
    told me that there could be abandoned gold mines, and all we got is a disgusting
    smell that I couldn't wash for weeks! At least this place looks promising, but
    I won't believe that there is something valuable unless I see it!
