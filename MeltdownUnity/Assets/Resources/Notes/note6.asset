  Title: 'Nestrova testing log 224 '
  Content: "Elemental core test 1: core works to specifics, heat receptors fire correctly.\r\nExpected:
    heat energy from the fire shot to tigger core.  \r\nResult : pulse of energy
    that can power low power objects\r\n\r\nElemental core test 2: core connected
    to lamp, set to heat=deactivate. \r\nExpected: fire shot to deactivate lamp.\r\nResult:
    when fired with the fire it triggered a binary switch tuning off the lamp \r\n\r\nconclusion
    : these cores since working correctly can be used to activate or deactivate other
    objects as needed. Need to pass to sato for ice testing\r\n"
