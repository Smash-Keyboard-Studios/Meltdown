  Title: To; Misha
  Content: "Getting inside this bunker was a challenge - I should've scouted the
    outpost's rotation before I got here, but now I lost my backpack with food and
    equipment in it! \r\nAlright, pull yourself together, Misha and I just got here
    and who knows what did they research in this facility, but I'm pretty sure that
    nerds who worked here left their stuff behind, which I can sell and secure my
    retirement just fine\r\n"
