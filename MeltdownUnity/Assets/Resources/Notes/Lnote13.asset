  Title: 'To: Head Reasercher Sechenova'
  Content: 'The new batch of ''Volunteers'' just arrived, and this one is the biggest
    so far, so I encourage you, Prof. Sechenova, to use them to the fullest extent.
    I just received a word from one of my friends back in Prison Guard that from
    this point on we won''t experience any ''supply'' shortages for our testing,
    so you can focus on developing the Experiment No.47 without even thinking about
    ''resource'' management. I would really like you to explain how actually the
    whole experiment is going so i can do that monthly report to my superiors.



    Thank
    you in advance,

    Major-General G.P.
