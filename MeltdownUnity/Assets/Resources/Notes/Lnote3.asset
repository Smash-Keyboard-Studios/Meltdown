  Title: 'To: Site Director Karimov'
  Content: "Site director\r\nSir, I am asking for you to once again tell the American
    to leave me alone. I do not care for his romantic advances nor do I find him
    remotely attractive and I told him that. It seems that my efforts are wasted
    because he chose not to understand what I told him! If he's so interested in
    a woman, then he should go to that shalava from processing. This is simply unethical
    in a facility like this! We are colleges in the first place for a reason - in
    the experiments this important for our country we need to go beyond our primal
    instincts and simply get the job done! Outrageous!\r\n\r\nSigned \r\nProfessor
    Nestorova \r\nElemental testing\r\n"
