  Title: 
  Content: "Dima I hope you find this. \nI slipped into this area and cannot climb
    back out, the walls are just too smooth. I'm sorry I dragged you here. If you
    find this i'm gonna try and get to the top of the facility, on the rappel down
    I think I saw what looked like a rusty staircase and if we are lucky it  may
    be an exit.\n\n If you read this please head to the highest part of this facility
    to meet me."
