  Content: "dima I hope you find this. \nI slipped into this area and cannot climb
    back out the walls too smooth, i'm sorry I dragged you here but if you find this
    i'm gonna try and get to the top of the facility, on the rappel down I saw what
    looked like a rusty staircase and think it may be an exit.\n\n If you read this
    please head there to meet me"
