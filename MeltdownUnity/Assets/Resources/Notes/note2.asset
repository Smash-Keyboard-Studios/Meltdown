  Content: "I goddamn hate this stupid pressure plate system you guys have installed.
    Zamira honey I know its not your fault but needing 2 people to open the door
    is just a pain. I don't wanna have to wait for someone to just stand around on
    a pad just to so i can do my job. Now I thank you for letting me know your lil'
    secret fix. I fabricated a few of my own and left yours behind the cupboard in
    the corner.\r\n \r\n\r\nDr Standish\r\nHead of Engineering \r\n"
