  Title: 'To: D'
  Content: "Look, I get ya like it, but it's just so bad. The design is both simple
    and bland, what were ya goin for? A birdbath for mount Olympus? It's a stupid
    dish and you want this pedestal to be what holds the crystals ? \r\n It's just
    bad \r\nThose crystals need a much more secure structure to contain that energy.
    Look my guys will design a better version. Next time dont get my guys to work
    on somethin without passing it though me first. As for the ones they built already?
    \r\nIf ya like it so much take it home and put it in yer garden. \r\nStiv\r\n"
