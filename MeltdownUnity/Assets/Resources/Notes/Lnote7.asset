  Title: 'To: Dima'
  Content: 'Dima if your reading this please try to catch up to me. I''m pretty sure
    i saw a figure moving ahead of me in one of the windows but i''m pretty sure
    you were behind me.this place has been abandoned for years so there shouldnt
    be anyone around. I''m kinda scared. This place has me so turned around. What
    were they experimenting on here.. Those weird crystals and all the locked doors.
    I''m feeling like this wasnt the cash out we expected. Just hurry ok.
