  Title: 'To: Dr Petrov'
  Content: "Hakase petrov, \r\nI have the report for you. \r\n\r\nAfter testing the
    cryonic blast is able to almost instantly freeze small bodies of water.the throughput
    has improved significantly since Hayward-san changed the feed tube. Will continue
    to test.  \r\n\r\nIt was also discovered by a volunteer tester that the cryonic
    has an effect on some machinery. \r\n\r\nThe service lift was effected slowing
    down its descent. I believe this would work on other such hydraulic or liquid
    based machinery. This could be good for offensive use. Will have to test the
    full capabilities of this.\r\n\r\nDr Hana sato\r\n"
